### Installation and Setup Guide

To run Spectech locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Spectech uses Java, so make sure you have the JDK installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

- **Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **MySQL Database:** Spectech relies on MySQL for data storage. Install and set up MySQL on your machine. You can download MySQL from [the official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### Backend (Spring Boot)


1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishperiyasamy/SpecTech-RestAPI.git


2.**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd backend/SpectechProject

3.**Build and run the Spring Boot application:**
./mvnw spring-boot:run  
This will start the backend server at http://localhost:8080.  
### Frontend (React)  
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:** cd frontend/spectech
2. **Install frontend dependencies:** npm install  
3.**Start the React application:** npm start

### Database  
Create a MySQL database for Spectech. You can use a MySQL client or the command line to create a database.  

Update the database configuration in the backend. Open the application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory and configure the database connection properties:  

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name  
spring.datasource.username=your_database_username  
spring.datasource.password=your_database_password  

Replace your_database_name, your_database_username, and your_database_password with your actual database information.  
### Final Steps
With the backend server running and the React development server started, open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000.  

You should now see and be able to interact with the Spectech application locally.
